This program calculates the factorial of a number using one of three different factorial function types.

Instructions:
The program is ran using 'paver run' and takes two arguments: function and number.
The function argument must be 'imperative', 'recursive', or 'functional'.
The number must be an integer.

Example inputs:
paver run -f functional -n 8

paver run -f recursive -n 8

Output:
Output will state the factorial of the input number is 

Example output:
The factorial of 8 is 40320
